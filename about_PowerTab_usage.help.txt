    about_PowerTab_usage

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes the uses of tab expansion that PowerTab offers.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    PowerTab supports additional usage scenarios for tab expanding commands,
    references and code constructs. This topic describes the general set of
    uses built into PowerTab, with examples. To try the examples, enter the
    exact text of the example and press the [TAB] key.

    PowerTab also offers specific support for many important command
    parameters such as enums, process names, and other information that
    PowerTab can look up. If a parameter is directly support, it will take
    precedence over the usage patterns described in this topic.


  PATHS
      Paths are the basic usage that PowerTab can handle. Any PSDrive path
      will work and relative paths will be preserved.

          .\
          HKLM:\


  COMMANDS
      PowerTab can complete the name of Powershell cmdlets, functions and
      aliases given hints. PowerTab will look for the "<VERB>-" pattern for
      commands. Adding a "%" character to the end of the search string will
      force PowerTab to search for any type of command (cmdlet, function,
      script, or application).  That character is configurable with
      $PowerTabConfig.ShortcutChars.Partial.

          Get-
          di
          %
          add%


  COMMAND PARAMETERS
      Command parameter names can be expaned for cmdlets, functions and
      scripts. PowerTab will also detect the corresponding command to the
      current cursor location.

          Get-ChildItem -
          Get-Process | Format-Table -


  VARIABLE NAMES
      Powertab can expand the names of variables, including quoting with "{"
      and "}" as needed.

          $
          $error


  VARIABLE PROPERTIES AND METHODS
      Properties and methods on objects stored in variables can be accessed
      with PowerTab.

          $error.g


  VARIABLE STATIC METHODS
      Static properties and methods of objects stored in variables can also be
      accessed.

          $error::


  VARIABLES BY SCOPE
      PowerTab will respect scope when expanding variable names with a scope.

          $global:


  VARIABLES BY TYPE
      Variable references to items on other PSDrives can also be expanded in
      PowerTab.

          $alias:
          $function:


  NATIVE COMMANDS
      To tab expand the names of native commands and executables, add the "!"
      character to the end of the search string (that character will be removed
      from the results). That character is configurable with
      $PowerTabConfig.ShortcutChars.Native.

          !
          net!


  HISTORY
      PowerTab supports expanding command history in the same way as the
      default tab expansion in PowerShell, using the "#" character to lead off
      the search string. That character is configurable with
      $PowerTabConfig.ShortcutChars.Native. Additionally, PowerTab supports
      wildcards in the search string.

          #
          #cd
          #12


  HELP TOPICS
      When looking up a help topic, PowerTab can assist by tab expanding the
      names of the available help topics.

  TYPES
      Type name expansion can be accomplished if .NET type names have been
      cached in the tab expansion database. Use the following patterns.

          [
          [System.
          [.DateTime
          .DateTime

      The last two examples will search for any namespace or type beginning
      with the entered string.

      To update the tab expansion database with a list of type names, run this
      command.

          Update-TabExpansionType


  TYPE STATIC MEMBERS
      Static properties and methods on .Net types are recognized by PowerTab.

          [System.DateTime]::


  TYPE METHOD SIGNATURES
      By pressing [TAB] after the first parenthesis of a method, PowerTab will
      offer safe syntax for all the available overloads of the method.

          [System.DateTime]::Compare(
          $Date.ToString(


  ENUMS
      Enumeration values can also be expaned with PowerTab.

          [ConsoleColor]::B


  WMI CLASSES
      References to WMI class names can be expaned with PowerTab using these
      patterns.

          cim_
          msft_
